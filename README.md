## Overview:
Spell checker is implemented using trie data structure where its each individual character represents a string, leading it to fast and memory efficient storage and retrieval. Here addition of words involves traversing the trie to create node branches for each character. Searching for a word benefits the organized data structure of trie, confirming its word existence. Removing a word requires traversing of trie to remove nodes, ensuring the dictionary is maintained updated.
